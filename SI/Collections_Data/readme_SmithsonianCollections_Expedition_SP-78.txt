Query has "No results to display"
The original data sheet only has "One Scorpaenid" under general notes where different species/genus/family are listed. Furthermore, the original data sheet does not have anything under "METHOD CAPTURE". Due to these issues, this station was not further pursued.

Files from the 3 exluded stations were concatenated to the file nmnhsearch_Expedition_SP-78.csv to creat the file:
SmithsonianCollections_Expedition_SP-78.csv

This file contains all specimen collected at 51 stations from the SP-78 expedition in 1978.
This file has 3,446 unique "Catalog Number - USNM"
These represent unique species encountered at each station.
There are duplicates which have a "Catalog Number - USNM" that starts with "RAD". These are radiograph images. Under "Kind of Object" they are "Image" instead of "Specimen/Lot" and should be discarded when analyzing the data.
