# Literature and Web Resources of the Analysis of Biodiversity Data

I am focused on papers that describe methodologies for comparing community similarity and biodiversity.

It is important to consider covariates, predictor variables that likely affect our response variables but we are not that intested in them. We want to test for an effect of MPA and time despite the effects of covariates.
* Rotenone volumne
* distance between locations
* depth
* habitat

I am also keeping an eye on community composition and biodiversity measures that account for phylogenetic similarity.  If we can account for this, I think it would be cool, but I am not sure if we have time.
* all species are equally different: all standard methods of comparing biodiversity
* species are not equally different
	* I added a few manuscripts regarding the relationship between ecological function and phylogenetic similarity and methods for incorporating phylogenetic differences in community comparisons
